# Pandoric Interface Project
This is a project to build a functional bot to do utilitarian jobs on my FFRP game Molten Aether.

## Bot Token
This program requires a Discord API token to operate.  To do this please follow the directions here:

## Configuration
The `example_config.json` file which comes with the bot represents the default bot configuration.  It is recommended you copy it to the default `config.json` file in the same directory the `pInterface.py` is in.  Optionally you can also specify the `-c` or `--config` option to tell the bot to load a specific configuration file.  If no path is provided, it will search in the directory the script is located in.
